Some readily compiled blobs for Nemo on Nokia N9


zImage-2.6.32.54-dfl61-20121301 is the "open mode" kernel for N9. This compiled version was taken from http://maemo.cloud-7.de/HARM/N9/1.3/openmode-kernel/ The sources can be found there as well http://maemo.cloud-7.de/HARM/N9/1.3/

zImage-kernel-moslo-n9 is the "MOSLO" image including initrd. This was simply extracted from kernel-moslo-n9-2.6.32.20112201-26.2.Nemo.Adaptation.N950.N9.armv7hl.rpm which had been downloaded from http://repo.pub.meego.com/home:/marquiz:/n950/CE_Adaptation_N950_Mer_Core-next-armv7hl/armv7hl/ The sources for MOSLO can be found on github as well https://github.com/nemomobile/moslo
